# Checkout .NET Challenge

For the .NET Challenge I used ASP.NET MVC 4 and C# to design a prototype with a single page website as View and implemented a simple shopping basket web API which allows the user to buy, and store their products with the option to continue to shop. It also allows the user to increment the product quantity and remove any unwanted product from the basket.

Controllers:
 - ProductController.cs
 - CartController.cs

Models:
 - Product.cs
 - Item.cs
 - ProductModel.cs
 
 Views:
 - Product
 - Cart

Note: Download and extract ShoppingBasket.rar and debug the solution to run index.cshtml (product view) on localhost.
